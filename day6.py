#LOOPS

# While Loop
# We use the reserved word while to make a while loop. It is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
# When the condition becomes false, the lines of code after the loop will be continued to be executed.


count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
#prints from 0 to 4
